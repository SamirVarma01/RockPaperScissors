# Rock, Paper, Scissors Detection Project

## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures representing **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**. It integrates a web application built using Flask for user interaction and real-time gesture recognition using OpenCV.

The application detects gestures through a webcam, classifies them, and draws a bounding box around the detected hand.

## Features
- Image Classification: Classify static images into Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

- Web Application: Upload images and get classification results using a Flask-based interface.

- Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Use a webcam to detect and classify hand gestures in real time.

- Interactive Feedback: Bounding boxes and labels are drawn on the webcam feed for real-time feedback.

## Future Enhancements
- Improved Hand Detection: Use advanced hand segmentation or detection methods for better accuracy.

- Multiplayer Game: Extend the application to support multiplayer rock-paper-scissors games using webcams.

- Mobile Integration: Deploy the model on mobile devices for gesture recognition on the go.
